  <center> The Ramayana is a Sanskrit epic from ancient India, one of the important epics of Hinduism. 

    <br> 
    The epic follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest urged by his father King Dasharatha, on the
     request of Rama's stepmother Kaikeyi; 
     
     <br> 
     his travels across forests in the Indian subcontinent with his
      wife Sita and brother Lakshmana;
      
      <br> 
      
      the kidnapping of Sita by Ravana, the king of Lanka, that resulted
       in war; 
       
       <br> 
       
       and Rama's eventual return to Ayodhya along with Sita to be crowned king amidst jubilation
        and celebration.</center>
